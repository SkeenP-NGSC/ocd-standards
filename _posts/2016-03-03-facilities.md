## Childcare Centres 0.1 (draft for comment)
**([Comments welcome!](https://github.com/okfnau/open-council-data/issues))**

"Facilities" are a broad range of services and amenities provided by the council which generally meet three criteria:
- they are in a specific building
- they are accessible by certain members of the public, at least sometimes
- they generally involve interaction with staff.

The range of services provided varies greatly across the country. It would be very difficult to define a precise vocabulary which every council agrees on, so if none the proposed types fits your need, please use another, and please open an issue or start a discussion to suggest it.
